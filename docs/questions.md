# Example questions

These are the six WildMap starter questions in `components/EmptyState.tsx`. Together they show the data layers available: trails, fire, forest loss, snow, campsites, and wildlife. Each should end with the matching layer drawn on the map and a short note.

The usual tool order is: find the place, move the map, query the layer, draw it, explain it.

## 1. Show hiking trails around Lake Tahoe

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_osm-trails` → `render` → `note`

The map flies to Lake Tahoe and shows a network of terracotta trail lines.

## 2. Which wildfires burned near Yosemite in the last 10 years?

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_fire-perimeters` → `render` → `note`

The map shows fire perimeters around Yosemite, and the note lists the largest recent fires by year.

## 3. Where has the Amazon lost the most forest since 2015?

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_forest-loss` → `render` → `note`

The map shows tree cover loss across the Amazon from 2015 onward; the note names the areas with the heaviest loss.

## 4. How much snow is on the ground around Mount Hood?

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_snowpack` → `render` → `note`

The map shows snow depth around Mount Hood, and the note gives the current depth and how recent the reading is.

## 5. Find campsites and forest roads open to vehicles near Moab

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_campsites` + `query_forest-roads` → `render` (each layer) → `note`

The map shows campsites together with forest roads that allow dispersed camping near Moab, and the note says which is which.

## 6. What wildlife has been spotted around Banff this year?

Tools: `geocode` → `set_view` → `query_species` → `render` → `note`

The map shows recent wildlife sightings around Banff, and the note summarizes the most commonly seen species.

## Notes

- If a query returns the hint `zoom_in`, expect an extra query call on a smaller area.
- `list_layers` may appear first in the trace; it does not change the result.
- Public data servers can be slow, so a query can take 10 to 30 seconds.
